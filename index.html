    <h1>Marie Curie</h1>
    <p>
        Marie Curie's groundbreaking research on radioactivity led to the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radium. Her work in isolating radioactive isotopes has had a lasting impact on medical treatments, particularly in the field of cancer therapy.
        Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fieldsâ€”Physics and Chemistry.
        Her contributions to science, despite the health risks of radiation exposure, paved the way for future advancements in both medicine and physics.
